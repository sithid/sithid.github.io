        <p>
          Greetings and welcome to my little webpage. Here you can find
          information about me, my projects, and other misc things.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a highly motivated and results-oriented software developer with a
          strong foundation in C# and a solid understanding of JavaScript.
          I also possess strong communication, problem-solving, and customer service skills, 
          honed through various roles in retail management and customer service. 
          I learn quickly and am excited to contribute to a collaborative team environment and
          continuously learn and grow in the software development and web
          development fields.

        <h2>Current Projects</h2>
        <p>
          I am actively seeking employment as a frontend/backend developer.  I am
          also currently working on my capstone project, "The Book Burrow", for Code:You as well
          as learning the Rust programming language.

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>
          After finishing my capstone project with Code:You, I intend to extend "The Book Burrow" 
          beyond the original scope of the project. I also intend to revisit my previous project, "DiscoverUO",
          and extend it beyond the original scope of that project. I also plan to find a project to write
          in Rust but I havn't decided on that.  Alternatively, if possible, I will join the Code:You data 
          analytics pathway (if they have a cohort starting and space available).
