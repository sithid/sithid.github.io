        <p>
          I am a highly motivated and results-oriented software developer with a
          strong foundation in C# and a working understanding of JavaScript,
          TypeScript, and Python. I also possess strong communication,
          problem-solving, and customer service skills, honed through various
          roles in retail management and customer service. I learn quickly and
          am excited to contribute to a collaborative team environment and
          continuously learn and grow in the software development and web
          development fields.
