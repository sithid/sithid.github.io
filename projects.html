            Various tools and utilities, frontends, etc for the ArtifactsMMO Api
            that I have written to play the game. Artifacts is a Sandbox MMORPG
            where you can use any programming language to control your
            characters with our API. You are free to use any programming
            language that can manage an API request. Everything contained in
            this repo was written by James Glosser. Node.js and Vue + Vite.
